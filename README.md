In this repository, you will find code and data for the manusctipt DOI: 10.1093/aob/mcae122 entitled "Pappus phenotypes and flight performance across evolutionary history in the daisy family" published in Annals of Botany.
All the code was created by me. If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact me at scostas@imbiv.unc.edu.ar.
Content as follows:
- Obtaining the final data set and tree
- Pearson correlation between Volume plume loading and Settling velocity
- Phylogenetic ANOVA: Plume loading ~ pappus_types. Associated graphics
- Ancestral reconstruction of pappus types using hidden states model (maximum likelihood) and Brownian motion and Ornstein Uhlenbeck models of character evolution (Flight performance - Plume loading). Associated graphics
- Phylomorphospace
- Evolutionary allometry in pappus-cypsela size:  Phylogenetic General least Squares - log(Pappus area) ~ log(Cipsela volume). Associated graphics
- Extra content we did not publish, including beautiful plots.
